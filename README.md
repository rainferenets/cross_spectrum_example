# Cross Spectrum Example

A simple example showing cross power spectrum computation between two complex valued input signals `s0` and `s1`. Cross spectrum is computed using Welch' method with Hamming winnow function.

FFT computations are done using `fftw3` library, so that must be installed before actually using the code.
